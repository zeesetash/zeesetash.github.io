## Introduction
The idea of a wage gap based on race or gender has been a subject of debate in the US. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should, in theory, have made all equal work receive equal pay, regardless of gender or race. This report seeks to analyze trends and the realities of a wage gap.

# Tipped Employees
According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, employees in "personal care and service occupations" are 26% male and 58% white and "food preparation and serving related occupations" are 46% male and 53% white. The most recent census estimate is the the US population is 75% white. These jobs are then disproportionately held by women and minority race groups. These jobs tend to be paid with tips more than a flat wage, which due to the methodolly used for reporting the data may have led to a "potential undercount in the hourly wage of workers who regularly receive tips or premium pay" and therefore a lower reported wage for women and racial minorities.
