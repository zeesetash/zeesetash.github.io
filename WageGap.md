## Introduction
The idea of a wage gap based on race or gender has been a subject of debate in the US. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should, in theory, have made all equal work receive equal pay, regardless of gender or race. This report seeks to analyze trends and the realities of a wage gap.

# Tipped Employees
According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, employees in "personal care and service occupations" are 74% female and "food preparation and serving related occupations" are 54% female.
