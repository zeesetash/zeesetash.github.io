## Introduction
The idea of a wage gap based on race or gender has been a subject of debate in the US. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should, in theory, have made all equal work receive equal pay, regardless of gender or race. This report seeks to analyze trends and the realities of a wage gap. All wage amounts are listed by hourly amounts converted into 2022 dollars. I have opted to focus on the median earnings in order to view the earners at the middle of the pack without undue influence from the extremely high earners.

### Gender Wage Gap

From the start of the reporting included in the data, men have consisantly earned more than woman. The greatest difference was in 1978, when the median wage per hour was $9.10 greater for a man than a woman. The closest median hourly wages for men and women were in 2011, where the difference was $3.42. Starting around 1990, the earnings followed similar trends of increases and decreases, but the gap has not closed.

The wage gap as a percentage is described as "median gender wage gap of 15.8 percent means that a typical woman is paid 15.8 percent less per hour than a typical man." The greatest wage gap was the same year as the greatest wage difference. However, the smallest wage gap was in 2021 at 13.9%. At best, for each dollar a man earned, a woman earned $0.86. The gap has certainly shrunk, but it is still there.

### Racial Wage Gap

There has consistenly been a difference in the median hourly wage based on race. There are a few points during which Hispanic and Black earners earned the same as each other, the both groups have consistantly earned less than White earners.

### Tipped Employees
According to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, employees in "personal care and service occupations" are 26% male and 58% white and "food preparation and serving related occupations" are 46% male and 53% white. The most recent census estimate is the the US population is 75% white. These jobs are then disproportionately held by women and minority race groups. These jobs tend to be paid with tips more than a flat wage, which due to the methodolly used for reporting the data may have led to a "potential undercount in the hourly wage of workers who regularly receive tips or premium pay" and therefore a lower reported wage for women and racial minorities.
