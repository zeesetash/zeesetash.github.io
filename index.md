This is a self driven project meant to look at the different performance levels of Virginia Public Schools. My analysis was completed using SQL, Tableau, and Excel.

[Cyclystic Bikeshare](Cyclystic_Bikeshare.html)

This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course. In this project, I analyzed a year of data from a bikeshare company to make recommendations on how to increase the number of annual members. I did my analysis using R.
