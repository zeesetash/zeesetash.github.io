## Data Analysis Projects

<img src="images/Study.png?raw=true"/>
This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics course. In this project, I analyzed a year of data from a bikeshare company to make recommendations on how to increase the number of annual members. I did my analysis using R.

[Bees in Maryland](bees.md)

I took inspiration from a DataCamp competition to showcase my skills in using R and creating a presentation for my findings. This project analyzes the preferred species of plants for Maryland bees.

[Virginia Public Schools](VA_schools.md)

This is a self driven project meant to look at the different performance levels of Virginia Public Schools. My analysis was completed using SQL, Tableau, and Excel.

I enjoy playing video games. I am not good at playing video games. Follow along with my journey through Hades the video game as I track my choices using Tableau, hopefully learning succeeding in escaping the Underworld.
